Now that you have pip downloaded, you can simply include or require it in your
applications. Two methods to do this are listed below.

1. Modify your php.ini

  Look for the line include_path='.:/usr/lib/php' and change it to
  include_path='.:/usr/lib/php:{path to pip folder}'.

2. Run your PHP with -d include_path.

  $ php -d include_path='{path to pip folder}' myapp.php

3. Copy pip into your project directory.

  If you want to run myapp.php, make sure your directory looks like this:

  ./
    myapp.php
    ...
    otherfiles.php
    public/
    pip/
      base.php
      io.php
      webapp.php
      ...

  Then you can simply require 'pip/webapp.php' in myapp.php.
